### Be Your Authentic Self

In order to succeed professionally, graduates from diverse background need not only academic achievements but opportunities and insights from role models they can identify with. The Careers Insight dinner provides this.

For many students from diverse backgrounds, they will be amongst the first in their family or peer group to enter their chosen profession. For these students their ability to excel can be impeded by  limited access to professional networks that understand the challenges of coming from a diverse background.

By bringing together a collection of successful young professionals, the Career Insights Dinner seeks to provide individuals with an opportunity to benefit from the expertise and experience of young professionals who are excelling in highly sought-after career paths.

This year's speakers include: Georgia Bennett (Mott MacDonald), Isi Ijagbone (DLA Piper), Gbolahan Ladipo (Nomura), Joel Semakula (Court of Appeal), Sravya Rao and Mayuri Pandya (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).
