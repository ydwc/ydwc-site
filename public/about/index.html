                <p><p>In the pursuit of success, people from diverse backgrounds face shared challenges. YDWC is comprised of young people from diverse backgrounds, who are often underrepresented in professional networks. Whether formal or informal, professional networks offer value to their members by providing access to knowledge, support and career opportunities. If you are from a diverse background then your parents (or grandparents) are likely to have embraced the challenge of moving to a foreign country. Perhaps they started off owning nothing and knowing no one, but grafted in pursuit of a better life for their family. YDWC provides a platform, for those who are from under-represented backgrounds, to access knowledge, support and career opportunities that would otherwise be difficult to access.</p>

<p>As professionals our members have already succeeded in so many way­­­s - and they have fulfilled on many levels the dreams their ancestors may have had for them. Yet there are still challenges - challenges that come with being first; the first in their family to go to university, the first to go into their chosen profession, the first to know how to compute an integral and the first to grow up speaking English as a first language.</p>

<p>And challenges that are broader still; being the only person who looks like they do in the workplace, reading that “multiculturalism has failed” and wondering who exactly is being talked about, and the Brexit vote has now bubbled up a whole series of new issues surrounding what it means to be a minority in a country like the United Kingdom. YDWC exists to not only enhance the career prospects of our members but to build relationships between exceptional talents who seek to be a force for positive social change within their communities.</p>

<p>Many diverse professionals feel as though they live a “double life”; feeling the need to subtly and reflexively change the way they express themselves all the time. The pressures of the modern working world often require them to change between different cultural and linguistic spaces and different parts of their own identities. Achieving career progression may require diverse professionals to adapt their communication to meet specific norms of speech, cadence which significantly differs from that which would be used among their family and peer group. The task of adapting to specific norms, without the support of cultural insiders or any form of cultural training, presents a unique challenge to professionals from diverse backgrounds. YDWC supports its members who are currently trying bridge this gap and seeks to be a force within society that helps to close this gap for future generations.</p>

<p>Warm Regards</p>

<p>The YDWC Team</p>
